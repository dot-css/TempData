# Requirements Document

## Introduction

TempData is a comprehensive Python library designed to generate realistic fake data for testing, development, and prototyping purposes. The library will support 40+ dataset types spanning business, financial, healthcare, technology, IoT, and social domains, with worldwide geographical capabilities and time-based dynamic seeding for reproducible yet unique data generation. The core philosophy emphasizes global coverage, realistic data patterns, time-based seeding, simple API design, and multiple export formats.

5. WHEN a user requests route simulation THEN the system SHALL generate realistic travel routes with appropriate waypoints and distances
6. IF a user specifies `country='global'` THEN the system SHALL generate mixed international data patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want time-based dynamic seeding that ensures unique data every run while maintaining reproducibility when needed, so that I can create fresh test datasets while being able to reproduce specific scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no seed is provided THEN the system SHALL use current milliseconds as seed base ensuring unique data generation
2. WHEN a fixed seed is provided THEN the system SHALL generate identical datasets across multiple runs
3. WHEN generating time series data THEN the system SHALL use temporal offsets to create realistic time-based patterns
4. WHEN generating contextual data THEN the system SHALL use context-specific seeds to maintain relationships between related data points
5. IF the system generates data at different times THEN each generation SHALL produce unique results unless explicitly seeded

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to generate time series datasets with realistic temporal patterns, so that I can simulate historical data trends and seasonal variations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user specifies `time_series=True` THEN the system SHALL generate data with temporal relationships and realistic time-based patterns
2. WHEN a user sets `interval='1min'` THEN the system SHALL generate data points at 1-minute intervals
3. WHEN a user provides `start_date` and `end_date` THEN the system SHALL generate data within the specified time range
4. WHEN generating financial time series THEN the system SHALL include realistic market volatility and trading patterns
5. WHEN generating IoT sensor data THEN the system SHALL include realistic sensor reading variations and temporal correlations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to export generated datasets in multiple formats (CSV, JSON, Parquet, Excel, GeoJSON), so that I can integrate the data with different tools and systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests CSV export THEN the system SHALL generate properly formatted CSV files with appropriate headers
